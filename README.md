# LoadSensingBase
This is a modification/revision/update to the Jflyer F-16 Grip on thingiverse. in thise design i took his model and changed it and modified it to fit onto a 2020 extrusion. i then used The open Viper Hotas V2 By Bacon8tor on thingiverse, which took the original Jflyer81 model and added pcb support so you dont have to wire every wire to each button, and rather just use 5 Pos Navigation Switches From ada fruit. i created my own base that uses loadcells to measure your force applied vs ange of motion. this is realistic to the actual jet as that f-16 has a force sensing stick rather than that of a F-15 which measure where your stick is using hall effect sensors. below i will list the things i used, the code produced during this project, the issues, the versions, and everything i have used to get started.
