# Overview
This is a modification/revision/update to the Jflyer F-16 Grip on thingiverse. in thise design i took his model and changed it and modified it to fit onto a 2020 extrusion. i then used The open Viper Hotas V2 By Bacon8tor on thingiverse, which took the original Jflyer81 model and added pcb support so you dont have to wire every wire to each button, and rather just use 5 Pos Navigation Switches From ada fruit. i created my own base that uses loadcells to measure your force applied vs ange of motion. this is realistic to the actual jet as that f-16 has a force sensing stick rather than that of a F-15 which measure where your stick is using hall effect sensors. below i will list the things i used, the code produced during this project, the issues, the versions, and everything i have used to get started.
# The Grip
To make the grip i used the Open Viper Hotas V2 By Bacon8tor. this is a remix of the original grip by Jflyer81 but this one has support for pcb such that you use Adafruits 5 way Thru Hole navigational switch. this means there is less soldering, 3D Printing, And effort in making this. everything went smoothely for me, but it depends on your printer. the pcbs were the tricky part, you have to order them from PCB Way or Any company that can manufactur pcbs. they take about 2 weeks to get here, and come fully assembled. they costed $20 and you get two sets of them depending on where you order them from. After all this it should go together realy well. links to all products are in the description.
# The Base
the base was probably the most tricky part. it went through many iterations, some worked some failed, but i learned from them all. the first design used traditionaly wheatstone bridge loadcells, like these seen here <img src="https://encrypted-tbn0.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:ANd9GcRwDXsmqYrnBvKlI4qTI3hgRt6SoX7Hc7H-qO6vfch9yXgBGuoxTyWAQO0D7l3JEMmTnhs:https://www.phidgets.com/productfiles/3135/3135_0/Images/3150x-/0/3135_0.jpg&amp;usqp=CAU" alt="Micro Load Cell (0-50kg) - 3135_0 at Phidgets"/>
