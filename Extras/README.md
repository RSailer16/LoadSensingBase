# Assembly
## Base 
### 1) First Start by Ordering/Buying the following
   - 2020 Extrusion
   - M4 Bolts
   - M4 T-Nut
   - Load Sensors
   - HX711
   - Teensy 4.0
### 2) Printing
next youll need the parts to print the base. print out every part listen in the STL-Files, then in folder "Base" youll find all the needed stl files to print these out.
once you have all 5 peice printed out you can begin to put it together
    1) first your gonna take the Base and take ribbon cable and wire it through the cut outs on the bottom. i used 28 guage 6 wire, ribbon cable, this is just to keep it more tidy.
    2) once the wiring is routed, use the wiring diagram to help make this easier. you solder 2 wires to GRN and 2 wires to WHT and one to RED and one to BLK. you need to follow the wiring diagram but once the wires are through the base you then solder the load sensors onto them.

### 3) once yout finish soldering everything i highly recommend running the HX711_Basic_Example code on the teensy, and test that the loadsensors are outputting numbers. once you run this on both pairs, move on to the next step.
